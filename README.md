# Godot Native Example

In this project:
- **An example C++ GDNative plugin.** 
- **Instructions to build the plugin including what software you'll need.**
- **Support for 💰Windows, 🐧Linux & 🍏MacOS (x86_x64/arm64).**
- **🤖 An automated build pipeline to build for all above platforms.**

## Buildling on Windows

1. Download and install:
    - https://git-scm.com/download/win
    - https://cmake.org/download
        - When prompted by installer, add CMake to the system path.
    - https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads (community edition is fine)
        - When prompted by installer, use 'Desktop Development with C++".
    - https://www.python.org/downloads **(must use Python 3!)**
        - When prompted by installer, add Python to the system path.

2. Open a CMD window and run the following commands:
  ``` bat
  git clone https://github.com/samsface/godot-native-example.git
  cd godot-native-example
  debug.bat
  ```
 
3. Open `godot-native-example.sln` that should of been generated by running `debug.bat` in previous step.

4. Run the godot project in the app directory of this repo. If it prints "ciao" to the output, it worked!

## For all builds

- You DO NOT need to copy the build files into the Godot project. CMake does this for you.
- You DO NOT need to restart Godot every time you rebuild. Godot will reload the plugin.
- On Windows, you need to stop debugging in Godot to rebuild, else you'll get a permission denied error installing the dll.

## Using the CI:

This project contains a github actions file that will build your project for all supported platforms every time you push changes. To use it, just Fork this project and then just push changes. You'll see the build status in the Actions tab of your fork. 

* Github actions free tier only gives you so many minutes of compute per month so be conciuous of this.
